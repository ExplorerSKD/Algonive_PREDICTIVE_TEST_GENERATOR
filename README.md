Predictive Text Generator
A simple yet effective Predictive Text Generator that suggests the next word or phrase based on user input. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically an n-gram model, to provide context-aware word predictions, similar to the autocomplete features in modern messaging apps and search engines.

üöÄ Key Features
Word Prediction: Intelligently suggests the next word as you type.

Context Awareness: Analyzes the sequence of previous words to provide more accurate and relevant suggestions.

Customizable Dictionary: Easily allows users to add new words, phrases, or their own text corpus to tailor the predictions.

Simple Machine Learning Model: Implements a straightforward n-gram or Markov Chain model, making it a great project for understanding the fundamentals of NLP.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

(Optional) A text editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/predictive-text-generator.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd predictive-text-generator

(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies (if any):

pip install -r requirements.txt

üíª Usage
To run the Predictive Text Generator, execute the main script from your terminal:

python main.py

Once running, start typing a sentence, and the application will display a list of predicted next words.

üß† How It Works
This project uses a simple n-gram model to predict the next word. An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text.

Training: The model is first trained on a corpus of text (e.g., a large text file). It scans the text and builds a dictionary of n-grams (e.g., trigrams, which are sequences of 3 words). For each sequence of n-1 words, it stores the possible words that follow and their frequencies.

Prediction: When a user types a sequence of words, the model looks up that sequence in its trained data. It then suggests the most frequently occurring word(s) that followed that sequence in the training corpus.

This approach is a simplified form of a Markov Chain, where the probability of the next word depends only on the previous n-1 words.

‚úçÔ∏è Customization
You can enhance the prediction accuracy and customize the vocabulary by adding your own words or using a different training text.

Locate the corpus.txt file (or the designated training text file) in the project directory.

Add your frequently used words, phrases, or entire documents to this file.

Retrain the model by running the training script (if separate) or restarting the main application. The more relevant data you provide, the better the predictions will become.
